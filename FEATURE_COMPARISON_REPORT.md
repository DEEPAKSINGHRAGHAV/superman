## üìù Conclusion

The React web application now has **significant feature parity** with the React Native mobile app for core inventory management operations. The most critical features (Billing/POS, Product Management, Batch Tracking, Expiring Products, and Supplier Management) are fully functional.

Remaining work focuses on administrative screens (Purchase Orders, Brands, Categories) which are important but less critical for day-to-day operations.

All implemented features follow React best practices, maintain consistency with the existing codebase, and provide a smooth user experience.
