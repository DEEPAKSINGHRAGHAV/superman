## 🔄 If You Need Activity Tracking Later

If you decide to implement real activity tracking in the future, consider:

### 1. **Create Activity Model** (Backend)
```javascript
const activitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    type: String, // 'product_added', 'low_stock', 'order_received'
    userId: ObjectId,
    entityId: ObjectId,
    entityType: String,
    message: String,
    timestamp: Date
});
```

### 2. **Create Activity API**
- `GET /api/v1/activities/recent` - Get recent activities
- `POST /api/v1/activities` - Log new activity
- Include user filtering, pagination

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- Use WebSocket for live activity feed
- Or implement polling mechanism
- Show actual system events

### 4. **UI Component**
- Fetch from API instead of hardcoded data
- Show loading states
- Handle empty state
- Add "View All" navigation
