# Batch Tracking Solution - Problem & Solution

## Your Original Problem

**Scenario:** 
- You have a product (e.g., "Coca Cola 500ml") with barcode "8901234567890"
- First purchase: Cost Price = â‚¹20, Selling Price = â‚¹25
- After few days, you buy the same product again: Cost Price = â‚¹22, Selling Price = â‚¹28
- **Question:** When scanning the barcode, how do you know which price applies to which stock?

## The Solution: Batch/Lot Tracking System

Instead of storing a single price per product, we now track **batches** - each purchase creates a separate batch with its own pricing.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Product Model** (Same as before)
- Product still has `barcode`, `name`, `sku`, etc.
- The product's `costPrice` and `sellingPrice` represent the **latest/default** prices
- `currentStock` is the total sum of all active batches

### 2. **New InventoryBatch Model** (The Key!)
Each batch tracks:
- `batchNumber`: Unique identifier (e.g., "BATCH2410070001")
- `costPrice`: Cost price for THIS specific batch
- `sellingPrice`: Selling price for THIS specific batch
- `currentQuantity`: How many units left in this batch
- `purchaseDate`: When this batch was purchased
- `expiryDate`: When this batch expires (optional)
- `supplier`: Who supplied this batch

### 3. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Logic**
When you sell products:
- The system automatically sells from the **oldest batch first**
- This ensures proper inventory rotation
- You always know the exact cost and selling price of items sold

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Coca Cola 500ml

#### Initial State
```
Product: Coca Cola 500ml
Barcode: 8901234567890
SKU: COKE-500ML
Current Stock: 0 units
```

#### Step 1: First Purchase (Day 1)
```json
POST /api/v1/batches
{
  "productId": "product_id_here",
  "quantity": 100,
  "costPrice": 20,
  "sellingPrice": 25,
  "supplierId": "supplier_id",
  "expiryDate": "2025-12-31"
}
```

**Result:**
```
âœ… Batch Created: BATCH2410070001
   - Product: Coca Cola 500ml (8901234567890)
   - Quantity: 100 units
   - Cost Price: â‚¹20
   - Selling Price: â‚¹25
   - Purchase Date: 2024-10-07
   
Product Stock Updated:
   - Current Stock: 100 units (was 0)
   - Latest Cost Price: â‚¹20
   - Latest Selling Price: â‚¹25
```

#### Step 2: Second Purchase (Day 10 - Price Increased!)
```json
POST /api/v1/batches
{
  "productId": "product_id_here",
  "quantity": 150,
  "costPrice": 22,
  "sellingPrice": 28,
  "supplierId": "supplier_id",
  "expiryDate": "2026-01-15"
}
```

**Result:**
```
âœ… Batch Created: BATCH2410170001
   - Product: Coca Cola 500ml (8901234567890)
   - Quantity: 150 units
   - Cost Price: â‚¹22
   - Selling Price: â‚¹28
   - Purchase Date: 2024-10-17
   
Product Stock Updated:
   - Current Stock: 250 units (100 + 150)
   - Latest Cost Price: â‚¹22 (updated)
   - Latest Selling Price: â‚¹28 (updated)
```

#### Step 3: Check All Batches for a Product
```bash
GET /api/v1/batches/product/8901234567890
# You can use barcode OR product ID!
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "productId": "...",
    "productName": "Coca Cola 500ml",
    "barcode": "8901234567890",
    "totalBatches": 2,
    "totalQuantity": 250,
    "priceRange": {
      "minCostPrice": 20,
      "maxCostPrice": 22,
      "minSellingPrice": 25,
      "maxSellingPrice": 28
    },
    "batches": [
      {
        "batchNumber": "BATCH2410070001",
        "currentQuantity": 100,
        "availableQuantity": 100,
        "costPrice": 20,
        "sellingPrice": 25,
        "purchaseDate": "2024-10-07",
        "expiryDate": "2025-12-31",
        "daysUntilExpiry": 450,
        "status": "active"
      },
      {
        "batchNumber": "BATCH2410170001",
        "currentQuantity": 150,
        "availableQuantity": 150,
        "costPrice": 22,
        "sellingPrice": 28,
        "purchaseDate": "2024-10-17",
        "expiryDate": "2026-01-15",
        "daysUntilExpiry": 465,
        "status": "active"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**âœ… ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:** 
When you scan the barcode, you can now see BOTH batches with their different prices!

#### Step 4: Make a Sale (FIFO in Action)
```json
POST /api/v1/batches/sale
{
  "productId": "product_id_here",
  "quantity": 120,
  "referenceNumber": "INV-2024-001"
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. System finds all active batches for the product (sorted by purchase date - oldest first)
2. Sells 100 units from BATCH2410070001 (oldest) at â‚¹25 each
3. Sells 20 units from BATCH2410170001 (next oldest) at â‚¹28 each

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Sale processed successfully using FIFO method",
  "data": {
    "quantitySold": 120,
    "batchesUsed": [
      {
        "batchNumber": "BATCH2410070001",
        "quantity": 100,
        "costPrice": 20,
        "sellingPrice": 25,
        "totalCost": 2000,
        "totalRevenue": 2500
      },
      {
        "batchNumber": "BATCH2410170001",
        "quantity": 20,
        "costPrice": 22,
        "sellingPrice": 28,
        "totalCost": 440,
        "totalRevenue": 560
      }
    ],
    "totalCost": 2440,
    "totalRevenue": 3060,
    "profit": 620,
    "profitMargin": "20.26%",
    "averageCostPrice": 20.33,
    "averageSellingPrice": 25.50
  }
}
```

**Result After Sale:**
```
BATCH2410070001: DEPLETED (0 units remaining)
BATCH2410170001: 130 units remaining
Product Total Stock: 130 units
```

## Key API Endpoints

### 1. Create a Batch (Manual)
```bash
POST /api/v1/batches
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": "product_id",
  "quantity": 100,
  "costPrice": 20,
  "sellingPrice": 25,
  "supplierId": "supplier_id",
  "expiryDate": "2025-12-31",
  "location": "Warehouse A",
  "notes": "Fresh stock"
}
```

### 2. Get All Batches for a Product (By Barcode or ID)
```bash
GET /api/v1/batches/product/8901234567890
# OR
GET /api/v1/batches/product/{product_id}
```

### 3. Process Sale (FIFO)
```bash
POST /api/v1/batches/sale

{
  "productId": "product_id",
  "quantity": 50,
  "referenceNumber": "INV-001"
}
```

### 4. Get Batch Details
```bash
GET /api/v1/batches/{batch_id}
# OR
GET /api/v1/batches/BATCH2410070001
```

### 5. Get All Batches (with filters)

}
```
**This automatically creates batches for each product received!**

### 9. Adjust Batch Quantity
```bash
PATCH /api/v1/batches/{batch_id}/adjust

{
  "quantity": -5,  // negative to reduce, positive to increase
  "reason": "Damaged items found during inspection"
}
```

### 10. Update Batch Status
```bash
PATCH /api/v1/batches/{batch_id}/status

{
  "status": "expired",  // or "damaged", "returned"

## Integration with Purchase Orders

When you receive a purchase order, batches are **automatically created**:

```bash
# Step 1: Create Purchase Order
POST /api/v1/purchase-orders
{
  "supplier": "supplier_id",
  "items": [
    {
      "product": "product_id",
      "quantity": 100,
      "costPrice": 20,
      "totalAmount": 2000
    }
  ],
  "subtotal": 2000,
  "totalAmount": 2000
}

# Step 2: Receive the Purchase Order
PATCH /api/v1/purchase-orders/{po_id}/receive
{
  "receivedItems": [
    {
      "productId": "product_id",
      "quantity": 100,
      "costPrice": 20,
      "sellingPrice": 25,
      "expiryDate": "2025-12-31"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** 
- âœ… Purchase order marked as "received"
- âœ… Batch automatically created (BATCH2410070001)
- âœ… Product stock updated (+100 units)
- âœ… Stock movement recorded
- âœ… Full audit trail maintained

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create first batch with price A
- [ ] Create second batch with price B (higher than A)
- [ ] Verify both batches show when querying by barcode
- [ ] Make a sale - verify FIFO (oldest batch used first)
- [ ] Check profit calculation includes both batches
- [ ] Test expiring batches endpoint
- [ ] Test inventory valuation report
- [ ] Create purchase order and receive it - verify batch auto-creation
- [ ] Test batch adjustment
- [ ] Test marking batch as expired/damaged

---

## Migration Notes

**For Existing Products:**
- Your existing products will continue to work
- When you receive new stock, create batches for them
- Old stock (without batches) can be tracked using the old method
- Gradually migrate to batch-based system

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Product model unchanged (except added virtual `batches`)
- Existing APIs still work
- Batch tracking is additive, not replacing

---

## Next Steps (Mobile Integration)

In your mobile app, when scanning a barcode:

1. **Show Available Batches:**
```typescript
const response = await api.get(`/batches/product/${barcode}`);
// Display all batches with their prices
```

2. **Process Sale:**
```typescript
const response = await api.post('/batches/sale', {
  productId: product.id,
  quantity: quantityToSell,
  referenceNumber: invoiceNumber
});
// System automatically handles FIFO
```

3. **Show Expiring Items:**
```typescript
const expiring = await api.get('/batches/expiring?days=7');
// Alert user about items expiring soon
```
