## 🔄 Integration Points

### How Accounting Integrates with Existing System:

1. **Sales → Accounting**
   - Every Bill creates Journal Entry (Debit: Cash/AR, Credit: Sales Revenue)
   - Reduces Inventory (Debit: COGS, Credit: Inventory)

2. **Purchases → Accounting**
   - Every PurchaseOrder creates Journal Entry (Debit: Inventory, Credit: Accounts Payable)
   - SupplierPayment reduces Accounts Payable

3. **Expenses → Accounting**
   - Every Expense creates Journal Entry (Debit: Expense Account, Credit: Cash/Accounts Payable)

4. **Inventory → Accounting**
   - Inventory valuation appears on Balance Sheet
   - Stock adjustments affect inventory value

---

## 📈 Example: Complete Financial Flow

### Scenario: Complete Sale with Accounting

**Current System (Without Accounting):**
```
1. Customer buys product → Bill created
2. Profit calculated per sale
3. That's it!
```

**With Accounting System:**
```
1. Customer buys product → Bill created
2. Journal Entry Created:
   - Debit: Cash ₹500 (or Accounts Receivable if credit)
   - Credit: Sales Revenue ₹500
   - Debit: COGS ₹400
   - Credit: Inventory ₹400
3. Profit calculated: ₹100
4. Inventory reduced on Balance Sheet
5. Cash increased (or AR if credit sale)
6. P&L Statement updated
7. Balance Sheet updated
```

## 🎓 Key Accounting Concepts for Retail

### 1. **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**
Every transaction affects at least 2 accounts:
- Debit = Money coming in (or expense)
- Credit = Money going out (or revenue)

### 2. **Accrual vs. Cash Basis**
- **Cash Basis**: Record when money actually changes hands
- **Accrual Basis**: Record when transaction occurs (even if not paid yet)
- Retail typically uses **Accrual Basis** for better accuracy

### 3. **Chart of Accounts Structure**
```
Assets (1000-1999)
  - Cash (1000)
  - Inventory (1100)
  - Accounts Receivable (1200)
  
Liabilities (2000-2999)
  - Accounts Payable (2000)
  - Loans (2100)
  
Equity (3000-3999)
