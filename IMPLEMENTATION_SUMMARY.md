## ✨ Conclusion

The React web application now has **substantial feature parity** with the React Native mobile app for core operations. The most critical features for daily business operations are fully functional:

✅ **Billing/POS** - Process sales efficiently  
✅ **Product Management** - View detailed product information  
✅ **Batch Tracking** - Monitor inventory batches  
✅ **Expiry Management** - Track and prevent losses  
✅ **Supplier Management** - Manage supplier relationships  

The implementation is **production-ready** for the implemented features, with no linting errors, comprehensive error handling, and a professional user interface.

Remaining work focuses on administrative features (Purchase Orders, Brands, Categories) which, while important, are less critical for immediate business operations.

All code follows React best practices, maintains consistency with the existing codebase, and provides an excellent user experience across devices.

**Recommendation**: Deploy the implemented features to production and gather user feedback while continuing development of the remaining features.
