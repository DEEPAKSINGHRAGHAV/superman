## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Category not filtering
**Check:** Look for useEffect watching selectedCategory in ProductListScreen.tsx
**Fix:** Should reload products automatically

### Issue: Search not finding products
**Check:** 
1. Backend server running?
2. Products exist in database?
3. Check console for API errors
**Fix:** Restart backend server

### Issue: "Searching..." never disappears
**Check:** setIsSearching(false) called in timeout
**Fix:** Should auto-hide after 500ms

### Issue: Typo tolerance not working
**Check:** Search query without category selected
**Note:** Advanced fuzzy search only works without category filter

## 🎯 Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty Search**
   - Clear search → Should show all products

2. **No Results**
   - Search "xyzabc123" → Should show "No products found" with clear button

3. **Special Characters**
   - Search "500ml+" → Should handle safely (no crash)

4. **Rapid Typing**
   - Type "coca cola" very fast → Should debounce (only 1 API call)

5. **Navigate Away During Search**
   - Type search, immediately go back → Should cleanup timeout (no crash)

6. **Long Search Query**
   - Type 100+ characters → Should handle gracefully

7. **Network Timeout**
   - Slow network → Should show error after timeout
