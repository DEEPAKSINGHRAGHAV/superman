## 💰 Real-World Impact

### Scenario 1: Supplier Payment
**Current System:**
- You know a PO has `paymentStatus: 'pending'`
- But you don't know: How much you've already paid? How much is still due? When is it due?

**With Accounting:**
- See exact outstanding balance: ₹50,000
- Payment history: Paid ₹20,000 on Jan 15, ₹10,000 on Feb 1
- Due date: March 15, 2024
- Aging: 30 days overdue

### Scenario 2: Customer Credit
**Current System:**
- All sales are cash/UPI (immediate payment)
- Can't offer credit to trusted customers

**With Accounting:**
- Customer buys ₹10,000 on credit
- System tracks: Customer owes ₹10,000
- When customer pays ₹5,000 → Outstanding: ₹5,000
- Can see all customers who owe money

### Scenario 3: True Profitability
**Current System:**
- Shows: Gross Profit = Sales - COGS
- Example: ₹1,00,000 revenue - ₹70,000 COGS = ₹30,000 profit

**With Accounting:**
- Shows: Net Profit = Sales - COGS - Expenses
- Example: ₹1,00,000 revenue - ₹70,000 COGS - ₹25,000 expenses = ₹5,000 profit
- **Reality check:** You're making much less than you thought!

### Scenario 4: Financial Statements
**Current System:**
- Can't generate P&L or Balance Sheet
- Can't show financial health to investors/banks

**With Accounting:**
- Generate complete P&L showing all revenue and expenses
- Generate Balance Sheet showing assets, liabilities, equity
- Ready for tax filing, loans, investor presentations

## 📈 Business Benefits

### 1. Complete Financial Visibility

Current: "I made ₹30,000 profit this month"
With Accounting: "I made ₹30,000 gross profit, but after ₹25,000 expenses, 
                  my net profit is only ₹5,000. I need to reduce expenses."
```

### 2. Better Cash Flow Management
```
Current: "I don't know when payments are due"
With Accounting: "I have ₹50,000 due to suppliers in next 7 days, 
                  but only ₹30,000 in cash. I need to collect from customers."
```

### 3. Credit Sales = More Revenue
```
Current: "Customer wants to buy ₹10,000 but doesn't have cash"
Without AR: "Sorry, cash only"
With AR: "Sure, I'll add it to your account. Pay by end of month."
Result: +₹10,000 sale you would have lost
```

### 4. Compliance & Legal
```
Current: "How do I file taxes? I don't have proper records"
With Accounting: "Here's my P&L and Balance Sheet. 
                  All transactions are recorded and auditable."
```

### 5. Strategic Decision Making
```
Current: "Which products are profitable?"
With Accounting: "Product A: ₹5,000 profit, Product B: -₹2,000 loss. 
                  Stop selling Product B, focus on Product A."
```
