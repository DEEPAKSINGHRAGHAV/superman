# Expiry Date Display Enhancement - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

Enhanced the visibility of expiry dates in two key areas:

### 1. Purchase Order Form - When Adding Items

**Location**: After adding an item to a purchase order

**Enhancement**: Expiry dates now show as a **prominent warning badge** with:
- 📅 Calendar icon
- Yellow/amber background
- Bold text
- Clear border

**Example**:
```
Product Added to Order:
├─ Product Name: Milk (500ml)
├─ Quantity: 50
├─ Prices: Cost ₹60 | Sell ₹80
├─ Total: ₹3000
└─ ⚠️ [Expiry Date: Oct 15, 2025]  ← NEW BADGE
```

### 2. Batch History - Product Batches

**Location**: Batch history screen for each product

**Enhancement**: Expiry information shown as **intelligent color-coded badges**:

- **🔵 Blue Badge**: More than 7 days (Normal)
  ```
  EXPIRES
  Oct 15, 2025 (45 days left)
  ```

- **⚠️ Yellow Badge**: 7 days or less (Warning!)
  ```
  EXPIRES
  Oct 15, 2025 (3 days left)
  ```

- **🔴 Red Badge**: Already expired (Critical!)
  ```
  EXPIRED
  Oct 01, 2024 (Expired)
  ```

## 🎨 Visual Improvements
