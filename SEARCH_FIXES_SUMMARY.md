## 🔥 10 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Category Filter Now Works
**Problem:** Selecting a category didn't reload products  
**Solution:** Added useEffect to trigger automatic reload  
**Impact:** Critical UX fix - filters now work instantly

### 2. ✅ Search State No Longer Stale
**Problem:** useCallback had wrong dependencies  
**Solution:** Added searchQuery to dependency array  
**Impact:** Search results always accurate

### 3. ✅ Removed Auto-Capitalization
**Problem:** autoCapitalize="words" broke search  
**Solution:** Changed to autoCapitalize="none"  
**Impact:** Natural typing, better search accuracy

### 4. ✅ Added "Searching..." Indicator
**Problem:** No feedback during 500ms debounce  
**Solution:** Added isSearching state + visual indicator  
**Impact:** Users know search is processing

### 5. ✅ Display Result Count

**Solution:** Pass totalCount to SearchBar  
**Impact:** Users see "X results found"

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Error Handling
**Problem:** Network errors crashed app  
**Solution:** Smart error handling + retry button  
**Impact:** Graceful degradation, better UX

### 7. ✅ Advanced Fuzzy Search
**Problem:** Not using powerful backend search  
**Solution:** Smart routing to fuzzy endpoint  
**Impact:** Finds products even with typos

### 8. ✅ Fixed Filter Chips Padding
**Problem:** First category chip cut off

            ↓
    Smart search hint appears

Category Click → Instant reload → Results with count

Error → Error banner + Keep products + Retry button
```
