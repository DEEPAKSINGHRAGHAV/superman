### **Scenario 4: Test with Real Data** (5 minutes - Optional)

If you want to see the FULL power of batch tracking:

#### **Step 1: Create a Product**
```
Name: Test Coke 500ml
SKU: COKE500
Barcode: 12345678
Cost: ‚Çπ20
Selling: ‚Çπ25
MRP: ‚Çπ30
Stock: 0
```

#### **Step 2: Create First Batch via API**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/batches
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Body:
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
  "quantity": 100,
  "costPrice": 20,
  "sellingPrice": 25,
  "mrp": 30
}
```

**Expected:** Batch created with 100 units @ ‚Çπ20/‚Çπ25

#### **Step 3: Create Second Batch (Higher Price)**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/batches
Body:
{
  "productId": "SAME_PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 150,
  "costPrice": 22,
  "sellingPrice": 28,
  "mrp": 30
}
```

**Expected:** New batch created with 150 units @ ‚Çπ22/‚Çπ28

#### **Step 4: View in Mobile**
1. Go to Products ‚Üí Find "Test Coke 500ml"
2. Open product detail
3. See **2 batches** with different prices!

#### **Step 5: Scan Barcode**
1. Tap Barcode scanner
2. Scan barcode `12345678`
3. **BOOM!** See both batches:
   - Batch #1: 100 units @ ‚Çπ25 (Cost: ‚Çπ20)
   - Batch #2: 150 units @ ‚Çπ28 (Cost: ‚Çπ22)

#### **Step 6: Process FIFO Sale**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/batches/sale
Body:
{
  "productId": "SAME_PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 120
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quantitySold": 120,
  "batchesUsed": [
    {
      "batchNumber": "BATCH...",
      "quantity": 100,
      "costPrice": 20,
      "sellingPrice": 25,
      "totalCost": 2000,
      "totalRevenue": 2500
    },
    {
      "batchNumber": "BATCH...",
      "quantity": 20,
      "costPrice": 22,
      "sellingPrice": 28,
      "totalCost": 440,
      "totalRevenue": 560
    }
  ],
  "totalCost": 2440,
  "totalRevenue": 3060,
  "profit": 620,
  "profitMargin": "20.26%"
}
```

**This proves:**
- ‚úÖ FIFO works (sold from oldest batch first)
- ‚úÖ Exact profit calculated per batch
- ‚úÖ Different prices tracked correctly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "No batches found" everywhere**

**Solution:**
Your products don't have batches yet. Create batches by:
1. Creating a purchase order
2. Receiving the purchase order (this auto-creates batches)
   OR
3. Use the batch API to create batches manually

### **Problem: Barcode scanner shows "Product not found"**

**Solution:**
- Ensure product has a barcode set in database
- Check backend is running
- Check network connectivity
- Verify barcode is correct

### **Problem: Navigation error when tapping "Inventory Valuation"**

**Solution:**
- Check `AppNavigator.tsx` has BatchValuationScreen registered
- Restart mobile app
- Check console for errors

### **Problem: Modal doesn't appear after scanning**

**Solution:**
- Check backend API is accessible
- Check `/api/v1/batches/product/:barcode` endpoint works
- Look at console logs for errors
- Try scanning a different product
